=================

Code simulating Adaptation and Learning in Diffusion Networks

At this moment only one example script working  `example1.m` and three implemented algorithms :

* ATC but with no cooperation
* ATC with Adaptive Combination Weights [1]
* Local Estimation ATC with LS adaptive Combiners [2]
