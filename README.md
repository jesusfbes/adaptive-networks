Code simulating Adaptation and Learning in Diffusion Networks

At this moment there are three implemented algorithms :

* ATC but with no cooperation
* ATC with Adaptive Combination Weights [1]
* Local Estimation ATC with LS adaptive Combiners [2]


## Example of use

See `example1.m` for an example of use
